 Introduction 
 Bacterial infections may be acute and life-threatening 
or chronic and relapsing. They may elicit noninflamma-
tory, pyogenic, granulomatous or lymphohistocytic reac-
tions. The most common tissue response, however, in 
acute inflammation is dominated by neutrophils. Al-
though studies of other indicators of infection such as 
sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein have been con-
ducted, they are less helpful than the total leukocyte 
count (WBC) in the acute care setting of the emergency 
department. In addition, the volume of blood required 
for these tests and the delay in obtaining results make 
these tests impractical. The WBC is presently the most 
readily available marker. 
 The relationship between acute infectious diseases 
and WBC, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and in-
creased number of band neutrophils has been recognized 
for many years. However, the efficacy of manual band 
count in predicting bacterial infections compared to the 
WBC and ANC is controversial. Some authors suggest 
that WBC and ANC are more reliable for the diagnosis of 
infection than a manual differential count  [1–6] , while 
others  [7–9]  found that the presence of a left shift shows 
a strong correlation with infection. The determination of 
band count is labor-intensive and the reproducibility is

 Abstract 
  Objectives:  To evaluate the value of neutrophil left shift pa-
rameters and neutrophil morphologic changes in diagnos-
ing acute bacterial infections.  Materials and Methods:  Pe-
ripheral blood samples were obtained from 105 patients 
who had a positive culture for bacteria. Automated com-
plete white blood cell count was performed as well as pe-
ripheral blood smear preparation. Absolute neutrophil count 
(ANC) and neutrophil band count were determined and the 
neutrophils were evaluated for morphologic changes, name-
ly toxic granulation, vacuolation and Döhle bodies.  Results:  
Band count was less sensitive than ANC and white blood cell 
count in predicting bacterial infections except in the elderly 
and infant population. Toxic granulation in neutrophils ap-
peared to be as sensitive as ANC in predicting bacterial infec-
tion.  Conclusion:  ANC and toxic granulation appear to be 
more sensitive than band count in predicting bacterial infec-
tions. However, band count has a greater sensitivity in in-
fants and elderly patients.

highly dependent on the technique and training of the 
examiner.
  This investigation was undertaken to better define the 
diagnostic values of ANC and total WBC for acute bacte-
rial infections and whether or not the manual differential 
count (band cell count) is necessary. In addition, the val-
ue of neutrophil morphologic changes in diagnosing 
acute bacterial infection was evaluated. 
  Subjects and Methods  
 One hundred and five patients, 55 males and 50 females rang-
ing in age from 2 days to 93 years, mean age of 34 years, with bac-
terial infections documented by culture, were studied. The pa-
tients were seen in King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Sau-
di Arabia, and had one or more positive cultures for bacteria. 
Cases of severe neutropenia  ! 1.0  !  10 9 /l or acute leukemia were 
excluded.
 Hematologic evaluation: peripheral blood samples were ob-
tained within 24 h of the positive cultures. Samples were drawn 
into vacutainer tubes containing EDTA (1.2 mg/ml anticoagu-
lant). WBC, neutrophil and 5-part differential count were ob-
tained using automated analyzer (Coulter LH 755). The cut-off 
points for leukocytosis and neutrophilia were based on normal 
international institutional values adjusted for age. The cut-off for 
leukocytosis was  1 9.6  !  10 9 /l. Peripheral blood smears were 
made and stained with Wright Giemsa stain for each specimen. 
Examination of white blood cells was performed by a magnifica-
tion of 1,000. Two hundred white blood cells were counted and 
the band count estimated according to the criteria of the College 
of American Pathologists Survey Manual  [10] . A cell was consid-
ered a band if there was a visible distinction between chromatin 
and parachromatin in the narrowest segment of the nucleus. A 
band count of 20% was considered an elevated count. The pres-
ence of reactive morphologic changes in neutrophils such as tox-
ic granules, Döhle bodies and cytoplasmic vacuoles was also de-
termined. 
 Results 
 Of the 105 patients, 22 were infants ( ! 1 year) and 20 
were elderly ( 1 70 years). The total WBC count range was 
2.9  !  10 9 /l to 50  !  10 9 /l with a mean of 11.4  !  10 9 /l. 
Cultures from various sites were positive for neutrophil-
evoking bacterial organisms ( table 1 ).
 The sensitivity for predicting a bacterial infection was 
best for ANC and neutrophil toxic granules followed by 
WBC, band cells, and Döhle bodies. Neutrophil vacuoles 
seem to be the least sensitive. However, in elderly patients, 
the band count seemed to be the most sensitive compared 
to WBC and ANC ( tables 2–4 ).

 Discussion  
 The relationships between acute bacterial infection, 
WBC, and ANC and increased number of band neutro-
phils have been recognized for many years. However, 
the diagnostic value of these WBC quantitative param-
eters, including elevated levels of bands as well as of 
qualitative parameters as indicators of acute bacterial 
infection are the subject of an ongoing debate. In the 
United States, some groups have even concluded that 
manual band counts are worthless in predicting bacte-
rial infections  [1–6] . The determination of band count 
is labor-intensive and the reproducibility is highly de-
pendent on the technique and training of the examiner. 
Some studies have recommended that total WBC and 
ANC should be monitored instead of the band count 
because these parameters yield more reproducible in-
formation  [10, 11] . On the other hand, despite the tech-
nical difficulties associated with the neutrophil count, 
many laboratories and clinicians, especially in Europe, 
still continue to use peripheral blood smears as a di-
agnostic tool for evaluating acute bacterial infection
 [7–9] . 
 Todd  [11] has suggested that band count or ANC is 
more accurate than total WBC in predicting bacteremia. 
These findings were supported by Sabah et al.  [12] , who 
indicated that an elevated band count was of a higher di-
agnostic value in detecting acute bacterial infection than 
either total WBC or ANC. Ardan et al.  [13] analyzed the 
clinical value of band cell count as a correlate to infection 
in patients who had culture-proved acute bacterial infec-
tion and normal WBC, and they found that an elevated 
band count had a sensitivity of 49%. Marchand et al.  [14] 
also suggested that ANC and band cell count were more 
accurate than the total WBC in predicting bacteremia. 
However, Gombos et al.  [15]  demonstrated that band 
count is a poor indicator of occult bacteremia and does 
not add any predictive value, and that WBC and ANC are 
better indicators of bacteremia. 
 Our findings indicated that ANC was far more sensi-
tive than WBC, while the latter showed similar sensitiv-
ity to that of band count ( table 2 ). However, band cell 
count was more sensitive in the more vulnerable patient 
groups, namely infants and elderly patients, superseding 
WBC in these groups.
 The utility of morphologic changes in neutrophils has 
also been debated. Liu et al.  [16]  described the usefulness 
of morphologic changes such as vacuolation and toxic 
granulation of neutrophils as a screening test for bactere-
mia in a febrile patient. In their study, the presence of 
toxic granulation and vacuolation was more predictive of 
bacteremia than WBC. 
  Sabah et al.  [12]  suggested that toxic signs in neutro-
phils were highly sensitive. Jafri and Cass  [17] also dem-
onstrated a high correlation between vacuolated neutro-
phils and culture-positive infections. Adams et al.  [18]  
disagreed, demonstrating in their study that vacuolation 
of neutrophils was not sensitive for sepsis. Gombos et al. 
 [15]  supported the findings of Adams et al.  [18] , finding 
minimal vacuolation and toxic granulations in speci-
mens from patients who had bacteremia.

 Our findings indicated that the presence of toxic gran-
ulation in neutrophils is sensitive in detecting acute bac-
terial infection, especially in severe infections with 78% 
sensitivity, while vacuolation is not sensitive, and actu-
ally the presence of Döhle bodies  is more sensitive than 
vacuolation.
 Conclusion 
 Our findings indicate that ANC is more sensitive than 
band count in predicting acute bacterial infection and 
that the band count as a single parameter is of a limited 
diagnostic value. Morphologic changes in neutrophils 
were helpful, especially toxic granulation. However, a 
combination of more than one parameter helps increase 
the sensitivity of predicting acute bacterial infection.
