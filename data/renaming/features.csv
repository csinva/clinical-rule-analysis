"The occurrence of ≥2 periods of intense, unremitting nausea and paroxysmal vomiting, lasting hours to days within a 6-month period",Nausea/vomiting
The pain is associated with ≥2 of the following:,
The pain is incapacitating and interferes with normal activities,
The pain is not feigned,
The pain is not generalized or localized to other abdominal or chest regions and is not relieved by defecation or passage of flatus,
The pain worsens or incompletely resolves with continued or escalating dosages of narcotics,
