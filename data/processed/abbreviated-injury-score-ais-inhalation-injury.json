The purpose of their study was to identify whether severity of inhalation injury correlated better with pulmonary parameters (e.g. lung compliance, PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio) and acute fluid resuscitation requirements than bronchoscopically assessed inhalation injury severity. They retrospectively reviewed 80 adult patients requiring intubation, mechanical ventilation, and flexible bronchoscopy for suspected inhalation injury within the first 24 hours of admission. They used the AIS&nbsp;classification to separate their patients into two groups of bronchoscopic inhalation injury: one including grades 0 and 1 and another including grades 2, 3, and 4.
