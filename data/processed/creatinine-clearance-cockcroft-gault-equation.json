Evidence suggests that eGFR measured by both MDRD and CKD-EPI show better concordance with measured GFR than does the CG equation, and so the use of these equations is appropriate for determining drug dosing.</li>\n</ul>"}, "next_steps": {"advice_en": "<ul>\n<li>Patients with decreased GFR are at higher risk of progressive kidney disease.
