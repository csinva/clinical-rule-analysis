Furthermore, in the emergency setting, a patient with a failing airway or respiratory effort requiring intubation will still require intubation, regardless of the Mallampati score. Although a higher Mallampati score may prompt an earlier call to anesthesia or other specialties for assistance, its application to the emergent setting (ED, ICU) may be limited, as the score was initially developed and has primarily been validated in the OR setting.</p>", "references_list": {"Original/Primary Reference": [{"href": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4027773 ", "text": "Mallampati SR, Gatt SP, Gugino LD, et al.
