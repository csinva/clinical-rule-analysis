When compared to gold standards of CT scan, diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL), and/or operative findings, FAST had a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 96%. FAST was further validated in 1998 in a much larger <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1191535/\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> (<em>n</em> = 1,540) by the same group. This showed that FAST is most sensitive and specific in patients with penetrating precordial wounds (sensitivity 100%, specificity 99%) and in hypotensive patients after blunt abdominal trauma (sensitivity 100%, specificity 100%). They concluded that the accuracy of FAST in these clinical scenarios justified surgical intervention on the basis of the FAST findings in these trauma patients. With the application of FAST outside of study protocols by non-experts and non-radiologists, the contemporary diagnostic yield of FAST ranges more broadly.
