Given the high-risk nature of suicidality, the ED-SAFE investigators opted for a quasi-experimental multi-phase design instead of a randomized control trial.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Patients presenting to eight EDs across seven states including large academic centers and small community hospitals were included. The objective of Phase 1, &ldquo;Treatment as Usual&rdquo; (TAU), was to obtain baseline data. Research assistants prospectively collected data from chart documentations of intentional self-harm, and patients received usual care. In Phase 2, &ldquo;Universal Screening&rdquo; (SO for &ldquo;screening outcome&rdquo;) was implemented with the 3-item Patient Safety Screener (PSS-3) by the primary treating nurse. In Phase 3, &ldquo;Universal Screening Plus Intervention&rdquo; (INT), those who screened positive had secondary screening by a physician to determine whether to consult a mental health specialist. Patients also received a safety plan and had up to&nbsp;seven subsequent telephone follow-up calls over the next year as part of their intervention. Outcomes were assessed by telephone interviews or medical record review at 6, 12, 24, 36, 52 weeks.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The 3-item Patient Safety Screener (PSS-3), which this calculator reflects, is the universal screen that was used for the ED-SAFE Study. The original Patient Safety Screener consisted of 5 items (PSS-5)&nbsp;derived from the <calculator id=\"1725\">Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</calculator> and <calculator id=\"10169\">Columbia Suicide Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</calculator>. PSS-5 assessed for anhedonia, depressed mood, passive suicidal ideation, active suicidal ideation, and lifetime suicide attempt.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The primary study by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23707435\" target=\"_blank\">Boudreaux et al (2013)</a> compared a 2-item and 3-item Patient Safety Screener (PSS-2 and PSS-3, respectively) with the well-validated but much lengthier Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSSI). The PSS-3 contained the questions of depression, active suicidal ideation, and prior lifetime attempt while the PSS-2 omitted the question related to depression. Patients unable to engage in conversation (intubated, altered, etc) were excluded. Patients tested positive if there was active ideation in the last 2 weeks or if there was lifetime history of suicide attempt. 951 participants were enrolled across three EDs; 459 participants were randomized into the PSS-2 group versus 492 participants in the PSS-3 group. Overall, 15.2% had a positive screen. There was strong agreement between the PSS-2 (Kappa 0.94) or PSS-3 (kappa 0.95) with the BSSI. However, the PSS-3 had stronger agreement with the BSSI compared to PSS-2 in regards to active ideation (kappa 0.61 versus 0.34, respectively).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In a prospective observational cohort study (essentially Phase 1 in the larger ED-SAFE Study) <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24033624\" target=\"_blank\">Caterino et al (2013)</a> summarized the baseline suicide risk screening rate. 94,354 charts were reviewed. One site had a version of universal screening as their &ldquo;treatment as usual.&rdquo; Excluding this site, overall, 12% of patients were assessed for self-harm. If this site were included, 26% of patients were assessed. In this Phase 1 study, only 2.7% of patients were documented as having current self-harm. In addition, Caterino et al found that younger men are more likely to be assessed for self harm and older adults are less likely to be assessed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To analyze the effect of &ldquo;Universal Screening,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26654691\" target=\"_blank\">Boudreaux et al (2016)</a> reviewed 236,791 charts. Documentation of suicide risk screening increased across the phases of the ED-SAFE study: 26% in Phase 1, 73% in Phase 2, 84% in Phase 3 (p &lt;0.001). With increases in screening, there were also increases in detection: 2.9% in Phase 1, 5.2% in Phase 2, 5.7% in Phase 3 (p &lt;0.001).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28456130\" target=\"_blank\">Miller et al (2017)</a> analyzed effects of implementing an ED-initiated intervention for patients screening positive on the universal screening. The intervention consisted of a secondary suicide risk screening by the treating ED physician, safety plan reviewed with the patient by nursing staff, and telephone follow-up calls by advisors trained on the Coping Long Term with Active Suicide Program (CLASP) protocol to reduce suicide risk. 1,376 participants were enrolled: 497 in TAU, 377 in SO, 502 in INT. They found that 89.4% had a secondary suicide risk assessment, but only 3.9% received the ED-SAFE designated secondary screening tool. 37.4% of the participants reported having received a written safety plan from the ED visit.</p>\n<p>Of the enrolled participants of the intervention group, 60.8% completed at least one CLASP telephone call. There was at least one suicide attempt in 20.9% of the participants over the study year: 22.9% in TAU, 21.5% in SO, 18.3% in INT. There was also a reduction in overall suicidal behaviors (suicide preparation, interrupted/aborted suicide attempt, suicide attempt, death by suicide): 46.3% overall, 48.9% in TAU, 49.6% in SO, 41.4% in INT. The intervention showed a small reduction in suicide risk and overall suicidal behaviors compared to &ldquo;Treatment as Usual,&rdquo; equating to an NNT of 22 and NNT of 13, respectively.<br /><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-43099a0d-7fff-ff14-2517-d3c09557e46f\"></p>", "references_list": {"Original/Primary Reference": [{"href": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23707435", "text": "Boudreaux ED, Miller I, Goldstein AB, Sullivan AF, Allen MH, Manton AP, Arias SA, Camargo CA Jr. The emergency department safety assessment and follow-up evaluation (ED-SAFE): method and design considerations.
