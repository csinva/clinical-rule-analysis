Several definitions are important when using this rule. Trauma visible above the clavicles implies any bruises, contusions or lacerations. Short-term memory deficits are defined as loss of anterograde amnesia, not the expected retrograde amnesia.</dd><dt>What recommendations do you have for health care providers once they have applied the New Orleans/Charity Head Injury/Trauma Rule?
