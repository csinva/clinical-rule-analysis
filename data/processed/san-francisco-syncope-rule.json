The initial derivation study (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14747812\" target=\"_blank\">Quinn, Stiell et al 2004</a>) was a single-center, prospective cohort study looking at patients with a chief complaint of syncope or near syncope. Fifty predictor variables selected from literature review and expert consensus were incorporated into a survey completed by the physician evaluating the patient after a syncopal episode. The patients were followed through hospital admission and/or contacted at seven days after the initial presentation to assess for serious outcome. The predictor variables associated with serious outcomes were identified on univariate analysis. Recursive partitioning was used to find the best combination of predictor variables that would maximize specificity while preserving high sensitivity. Once the combination of predictors was identified, the rule was applied to the derivation set of patients resulting in sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 62%.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The rule was validated by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16631985\" target=\"_blank\">Quinn et al</a> two years later with another single-center, prospective cohort study. Physicians treated patients with syncope or near syncope in their usual manner and were then asked to fill out a questionnaire about the patients that included the five SF syncope predictors. After following the patients for 30 days, the SF Syncope Rule was able to predict serious outcomes in all but one patient (sensitivity 98%). The rule boasted higher specificity than physician judgement (specificity 56%), estimating a decrease in overall admission rate by 7% if applied. The one missed patient was a suspected TIA related to extensive carotid and vertebral artery disease requiring a stent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Several external validation studies and meta-analyses have also examined the SF Syncope Rule in the time since the derivation study. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17210201\" target=\"_blank\">Sun et al</a> externally validated the rule with a single center, prospective cohort study with a sample size of 477 patients. Using definitions, exclusion criteria, and methods similar to the internal validation study, they found a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 42%. &nbsp;Of the 6 patients misclassified as low risk, 3 were dysrhythmias, 1 CVA, 1 ICH, and 1 HOCM. &nbsp;&nbsp;This study also compared physician judgment to the clinical decision rule. Physician judgment had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 30% for predicting serious outcomes at 7 days.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another single-center, prospective, observational cohort study by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18282636\" target=\"_blank\">Birnbaum et al</a> performed at a large urban academic center in New York found the SF Syncope Rule did not perform as well as previously reported. The study found the rule had a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 54% for predicting serious outcomes at 7 days. &nbsp;The rule would have decreased overall admission rate by 41% but misclassified 16 of the 61 patients with serious outcomes as low risk. Physician judgement in this study was 100% sensitive. In a written response to the study published in Annals of Emergency Medicine, derivation study authors criticized the study for incorrect application of EKG criteria used to define high-risk in the study. The original study authors argued the subjective interpretation of the EKG is enhanced when performed by treating physician familiar with clinical context. They posited the sensitivity of the rule in the New York study was decreased because EKGs were retrospectively evaluated by experts rather than evaluated by the physician seeing the patient. &nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Meta-analyses published in the Annals of Emergency Medicine (AEM) and the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) found sensitivity and specificity similar to the external validation study by Sun et al.
