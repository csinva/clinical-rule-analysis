The pathophysiology is thought to be due to capillary rupture within alveoli leading to hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, which then reduce gas exchange, causing hypoxia and hypercarbia.</li> <li>Clinical suspicion of primary BLI should be high after blast injury within an enclosed space, as the blast wave becomes amplified as it reflects off of the structural walls (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8970558\" target=\"_blank\">Leibovici 1996</a>).</li> <li>Characteristic chest x-ray shows bilateral diffuse opacities in a \u201cbutterfly\u201d pattern.

Contrary to previous belief that the clinical picture of BLI may develop over 24 to 48 hours, studies have shown that patients do not present with a delay in manifestation of lung injury (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9925079\" target=\"_blank\">Pizov et al 1999</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16307948\" target=\"_blank\">Avidan et al 2005</a>). </li> <li>Similarly, it was previously suggested that tympanic membrane (TM) rupture, the most common primary blast injury, was a marker for increased risk of development of BLI.
