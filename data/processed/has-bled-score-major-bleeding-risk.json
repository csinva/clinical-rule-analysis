Was there a clinical experience that inspired you to create this tool for clinicians?</dt> <dd>Increasing awareness of the evidence that oral anticoagulation is a necessity in the vast majority of atrial fibrillation (AF) patients, outdated paradigms to withhold anticoagulation (e.g. fall risk) and a lacking user-friendly counterpart to stroke risk assessment (e.g. <calculator id='801'>CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc</calculator>) despite the inherent (antithrombotic drug related) risk of bleeding led us to develop the HAS-BLED score.</dd> <dt>What pearls, pitfalls and/or tips do you have for users of the HAS-BLED score? Are there cases when it has been applied, interpreted, or used inappropriately?</dt> <dd>The most important pitfall is using HAS-BLED as an absolute cut-off to withhold or withdraw anticoagulation. Keep in mind that in the vast majority of AF patients risk of stroke (and associated outcome) outweighs risk of bleeding. Instead, HAS-BLED should be used as an alarmbell which assists in minimizing the potential risk of bleeding by signaling risk factors that can be avoided or reversed. Both important to note and as a good example of the alarmbell function is that the \u201dH\u201d in HAS-BLED (opposed to the stroke risk equivalent) does not stand for history of hypertension but refers to the actual systolic blood pressure (\u2265160 mmHg scores 1 point). Thus, explain the importance of blood pressure control and actively lower it accordingly to reverse it as risk factor for major bleeding, i.e. lose 1 HAS-BLED point and lower the bleeding risk (whereas the risk of stroke remains the same!).</dd> <dt>What recommendations do you have for health care providers once they have the HAS-BLED score result? Are there any adjustments or updates you would make to the score given recent changes in medicine?</dt> <dd>Antithrombotic management is not about a single, simple decision to initiate antithrombotic drugs or not. Antithrombotic management is all about the continuous balancing of risk (assessment) and communication.
