Of the 161 patients, a diagnosis for their dyspnea could only be determined in 153 patients, who constituted the research cohort. Patients\u2019 mMRC scores were compared to other dyspnea measures (BDI and OCD) and spirometric results (FEV\u2081, FVC, and maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures).
