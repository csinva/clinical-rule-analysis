"<p dir=\"ltr\">The VACO Index was derived from VA patients with positive COVID-19 testing in their health system; it was derived based on 3,681 patients, then validated in two separate internal

was predictive of mortality, especially when the <a href=\"https://www.mdcalc.com/charlson-comorbidity-index-cci\">Charlson Comorbidity Index</a> (CCI) was included in the risk model. Since the CCI incorporates a patient's entire spectrum of comorbidities, myocardial infarction and peripheral vascular disease were the other two independent predictors of mortality once the CCI was included. The authors speculate that this \" information underscores the likely importance of thrombotic complications in COVID-19.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since the VACO Index was derived and developed on patients early in the COVID-19 pandemic, and testing was especially limited at that time, it may slightly over-estimate mortality risk in later patients, as seen in the study's late validation cohort. It may also be that additional experience with COVID-19 has led to better management of patients, lowering mortality compared to at the beginning of the pandemic. For example, the authors note \"Overall mortality rate in our development cohort was nearly three times that found in our most recent validation cohort (13% vs 5%).\" The authors note as testing capacity increases, more patients will be tested for COVID-19, likely reducing the mortality rate (by increasing the denominator).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This calculator does include race in its analysis and derivation of its risk model, with non-Hispanic white patients having higher mortality. However, after adjustment for age and CCI, these racial differences vanished.
