The authors noted that the Bastion Classification appeared to be predictive of initial musculoskeletal treatment but was less useful in predicting the need for proximal vascular control, especially in the most common Class 3 injuries. The original study by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22613453\" target=\"_blank\">Jacobs et al</a> showed Class 3 injuries correlated with a higher rate of intra- or extra-peritoneal iliac vessel control (23% of 83 Class 3 injured limbs without associated abdominal injuries) compared to the study by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22910814\" target=\"_blank\">Lundy et al</a>, which only had 1 patient with a Class 3 injury without associated abdominal injury and 6 (5%) of all injured limbs requiring iliac vessel control.
