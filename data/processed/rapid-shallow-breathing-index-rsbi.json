They found the RSBI to have a </span><strong>sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 64%.</strong><span> In other words, the probability of having a positive RSBI in patients who were successfully extubated was 97%, and the probability of having a negative RSBI in patients who were unsuccessfully extubated was 64%. Successful extubation was defined as the patient still breathing on their own for at least 24 hours following extubation. After that, numerous follow-up studies were performed to look at the RSBI, many of which were summarized in a 2001 meta-analysis by </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11742961\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span>Meade et al</span></a><span>. Their </span><strong>pooled sensitivity and specificity were somewhat poorer: 84% and 44%, </strong><span>respectively, with a </span><strong>pooled positive likelihood ratio of 1.49 and a pooled negative likelihood ratio of 0.39.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Caveats</strong></p>\n<p><span>As stated before, the RSBI is worse at predicting failure of extubation. Some studies have helped to elucidate which subsets of patients may be more likely to have a false negative RSBI, including the following: female gender, smaller endotracheal tube size, and active closed-system suctioning. </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8970349\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span>Epstein and Ciubotaru</span></a><span> looked retroactively at 218 ICU patients that were ultimately successfully extubated and had a documented RSBI within 24 hours preceding extubation, and found that &ldquo;women were more likely to have [RSBI]&gt;100&hellip;lower tidal volumes&hellip;and higher respiratory rate&hellip;&rdquo; (</span><em><span>p</span></em><span> &lt;0.05 for all these findings). Thus, the RSBI calculation results in an inflated number value in female patients. </span></p>\n<p><span>This paper also found that patients with smaller endotracheal tubes had, on average, a higher RSBI, which also reached statistical significance. Furthermore, they found that the effect that a small endotracheal tube had on inflating a patient&rsquo;s RBSI was more pronounced in women than in men. Another study by </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19245731\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span>Seymour et al in 2009</span></a><span> observed that when intubated patients are being suctioned during spontaneous breathing trials, respiratory rate increases and tidal volume decreases, which would also artificially inflate the calculated RSBI.</span></p>\n<p><span>Another index that is potentially more useful than the RSBI in predicting extubation success is the maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), also referred to as negative inspiratory force (NIF), which is the maximum negative pressure generated inhaling against an obstructed airway. The MIP can be thought of as a proxy measurement for respiratory muscle strength. A recent paper by </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26834339\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span>Bien Udos et al</span></a><span> compared the predictive value of the MIP versus the RSBI in a population of 195 patients and found that the MIP compared favorably with a sensitivity and specificity of 93% and 95%, respectively, compared with their measurements of the RSBI&rsquo;s sensitivity in the same population: 84% and 91%, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Outcomes Data</strong></p>\n<p><span>A </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16878032\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span>2006 RCT in </span><em><span>Critical Care Medicine</span></em></a><span> sought to determine whether a clinical practice algorithm incorporating RSBI would change outcomes compared with an algorithm that was identical except with RSBI omitted. They found that the algorithm incorporating RSBI prolonged the time that it took to liberate patients from the ventilator by one day, and did not result in any difference in the rates of in-hospital mortality, extubation failure, or need for tracheostomy. This raised the concern that the RSBI leads to unnecessary delays in extubation without any demonstrable benefit. However, the algorithm required that a patient have a positive RSBI in order to proceed to SBT. As discussed above, there exists a subset of patients in whom the RSBI will be a false negative. Thus, it is quite possible that some of these patients whose SBT was pushed back because of a negative RSBI result were indeed ready to proceed to an SBT. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong>A Few Finer Points</strong></p>\n<p><span>The original study by Yang and Tobin calculated the RSBI using a manual tidal volume measurement, via a spirometer connected to the patient&rsquo;s endotracheal tube during a one-minute period of spontaneous breathing before an SBT. Tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>) was calculated by taking the minute ventilation and dividing it by the respiratory rate, f. Naturally, it is much easier to measure the RSBI by looking at the measurements automatically taken by the vent machine. A study by </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26785962\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Souza and Lugon</a><span> verified that measuring tidal volume via the vent machine&rsquo;s readings was consistent with the manual measurement taken on the same patient. In this study, measuring V<sub>T</sub> manually was performed identically to the original Yang study. Whereas, measuring V<sub>T</sub> via the vent was performed by placing the patient on pressure support for 5 minutes, then once again dividing the average minute ventilation over this time period by the average respiratory rate.</span></p>\n<p><span>Another question that has arisen following the rise of RSBI&rsquo;s popularity is whether it is applicable to patients who have been mechanically ventilated for a prolonged period of time. </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22770598\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span>Verceles et al</span></a><span> examined the applicability of the RSBI to patients in a long term acute care facility who had been mechanically ventilated for &gt;21 days, all of whom had underwent tracheostomy. They found no relationship between initial RSBI or daily RSBI and likelihood of successful liberation from the vent. However, they did find that, over the entire course of the patient stay, the </span><em><span>average </span></em><span>RSBI value was statistically lower in patients who were ultimately successfully liberated from the vent. That being said, the average RSBI values were patients that were weaned versus not weaned were 78.7 and 99.3, respectively. In other words, this is a departure from the traditional application of the RSBI as a binary result (either positive or negative), so it is difficult to apply the results of this study to actual practice.</span></p>", "references_list": {"Validation": [{"text": "Bien Udos S, Souza GF, Campos ES, et al.
