They enrolled 3,024 patients who presented with chest pain and/or dyspnea. There were 58 patients diagnosed with acute PE. Using the 95% oxygen saturation cutoff from the original PERC rule (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15304025\">Kline 2004</a>), the sensitivity was 96.6%. There were two patients who were PERC negative who were diagnosed with acute PE. When they used the altitude-adjusted PERC rule, 4.3% of PERC-positive patients were reclassified as PERC negative. One of the patients who was reclassified as PERC negative had an acute PE, so the sensitivity for the altitude-adjusted PERC rule was slightly less at 94.8%. They estimated that using the altitude-adjusted PERC reduced the number of CTPA scans by 2.7% compared to using the original PERC. </p>", "references_list": {"Original/Primary Reference": [{"href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18272098/", "text": "Wolf SJ, Mccubbin TR, Nordenholz KE, Naviaux NW, Haukoos JS.
