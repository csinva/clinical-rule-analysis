One large (n = 2,320) multicenter observational study by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24098983\" target=\"_blank\">Gerber et al</a> looked at a 9-year period in which increased adherence to the Brain Trauma Foundation management guidelines regarding use of ICP and CPP targets was correlated with significantly improved mortality, making the case for clinical application of these guidelines.

Multiple studies have shown an increased risk of hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS in those patients treated to a target CPP &gt;70 mmHg. In a single-center RCT comparing ICP-directed management versus cerebral blood flow-directed (CBF-directed) management, the latter of which involved maintaining CPP &gt;70 mmHg, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11596949\" target=\"_blank\">Contant et al</a> found a fivefold higher risk of ARDS in patients in the CBF-directed management group (15% versus 3.3%).</p> <p>In a retrospective cohort study by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16215372\" target=\"_blank\">Cremer et al</a>, the study investigators found that, among those TBI patients who survived 24 hours past the initial brain injury, CPP evaluation to guide clinical decision-making was associated with no difference in mortality, but doubled the number of ventilator-dependent days (5 vs. 12). However, the cohort of patients for whom CPP evaluation was used to guide care in this study were treated to a target CPP &gt;70 mmHg, therefore it is not surprising that these patients required longer mechanical ventilation.</p> <p>Other studies have found no additional mortality benefit to maintaining CPP &gt;70 mmHg. Thus, targeting a CPP &gt;70 mmHg is not recommended, as it is associated with increased complications without increased benefit.</p>", "references_list": {"Original/Primary Reference": [{"href": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16698860 ", "text": "Steiner LA, Andrews PJ.
