Because referrals were predominantly from ED attendances or other institutions (i.e., referrals typically because a simple peripheral etiology to vertigo was not apparent on assessment by a non-neuro-ophthalmologist), the cohort was older (mean 62 years), mostly male (65%), and overall at higher risk of vascular disease (70% had &ge;2 stroke risk factors). Most were seen after 24 hours of symptom onset, with a mean examination time for the entire cohort of 26 hours. Acute MRI was performed in 97%, with repeat imaging at 2-10 days for the 8 patients with central localization but initial negative MRI for stroke. Peripheral localization was confirmed with caloric testing. 76 patients were found to have a central lesion, and overall the authors found the HINTS examination to be 100% sensitive and 96% specific.

This found a lower sensitivity, with a 5.9% risk of missed stroke with HINTS alone.
