It was a prospective observational cohort study using data from the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN). Data were collected from 20 centers over the course of 2.5 years. Patients were either tracked through hospital admission, contacted by phone 7 days after ED visit, mailed a survey, or investigators reviewed medical records, registries, and morgue records to determine if there was an intra-abdominal injury (IAI) requiring acute intervention or death related to IAI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Acute intervention in the setting of intra-abdominal injury was defined as any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Death due to IAI.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Laparotomy with therapeutic intervention.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Angiographic intervention for hemorrhage.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Blood transfusion for anemia related to hemorrhage.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">IV fluids for &ge;2 nights due to pancreatic or GI injury.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ED physicians completed a standardized data collection form prior to CT scan (if performed), and variables assessed in the forms were chosen based on previous literature and plausibility, and the prediction rule was derived using binary recursive partitioning to maximize sensitivity.&nbsp; Any variable missing from &gt;5% of the data collection forms was omitted from recursive partitioning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">12,044 were enrolled, and of those patients, 5,514 (46%) underwent abdominal CT.&nbsp; 761 patients (6.3% of total enrolled) were diagnosed with IAI, and IAI requiring acute intervention was identified in 203 patients (26.7% of patients with IAI). The most common acute intervention was blood transfusion (60.1%), followed by therapeutic laparotomy (56.6%).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Of the 203 patients with IAI requiring intervention, 6 were misclassified as very low risk using the prediction rule, giving it a sensitivity of 97% (95% CI [94-99%]).&nbsp; Characteristics of those 6 patients are described in Pearls/Pitfalls.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Abdominal CT scan was obtained in 46% of the study population. The authors calculated that if CT of the abdomen was not performed on patients with zero of the predictive variables for intra-abdominal trauma, it would have reduced the number of CT scans to 35% of the study population.&nbsp; Interestingly, if a CT was obtained on all patients with at least one positive predictor variable, it would have increased the total number of abdominal CT scans obtained on the study population to 58%. The authors directly state that this does not mean every patient with at least one positive predictor variable requires abdominal CT to rule out injury. The purpose of this study was &ldquo;to identify the very low risk patients in whom CT could generally be obviated.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30502218\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Springer et al (2018)</a> validated the rule in a retrospective review of pediatric patients presenting to a single level 1 trauma center with blunt abdominal trauma over a nearly 5 year period. Unlike PECARN, this database included spinal and pelvic injuries in addition to intra-abdominal injuries, as well as patients with injuries occurring &gt;24 hours prior to presentation and those transferred from another facility where CT or DPL were already performed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The study authors identified 133 patients with IAI requiring intervention. One patient was truly misclassified as very low risk, a 15 year old with an adrenal laceration and liver laceration requiring a blood transfusion. The patient also had a femur fracture with superficial femoral artery damage requiring immediate operative revascularization and causing large-volume blood loss, and the study authors could not definitively attribute the transfusion requirement to intra-abdominal injuries.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The prediction rule was found to have 99% sensitivity (95% CI 96-100%) for the validation study. Despite attempts to include patients with spinal and pelvic trauma, the study authors did not identify patient&rsquo;s whose injuries met the proposed criteria; thus, no conclusions could be made in regards to spinal or pelvic trauma.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A planned secondary analysis of data from the original derivation study found that the decision rule was more sensitive than unstructured clinical suspicion for identifying IAI requiring intervention (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26302354\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mahajan 2015</a>).&nbsp; The clinician&rsquo;s suspicion was much more specific. These results were based on surveys completed by the treating clinicians obtained prior to the CT scan and at the same time as the standardized data collection forms for the derivation study. Interestingly, CT scan were still obtained in 33% of the cases where clinicians had a &lt;1% suspicion for IAI-I. The main reason cited for obtaining the scan despite very low suspicion was concerning mechanism of injury.</p>", "references_list": {"Original/Primary Reference": [{"href": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23375510", "text": "Holmes JF, Lillis K, Monroe D, et al.
