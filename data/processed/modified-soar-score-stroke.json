The AUC for predicting either inpatient or 7-day mortality was 0.79 (95% CI 0.78-0.80). Importantly, this analysis was restricted to inpatient mortality only; stroke severity as measured by the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was unknown, and functional status was based on medical documentation rather than interview. </p> <p>The SOAR Score was then externally validated by <a href=\"http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/44/7/2010.long\" target=\"_blank\">Kwok et al</a> in 2013 in an analysis of approximately 3,500 patients, also from a multi-center UK population, with the addition of investigating the predictive ability for 7-day mortality. The SOAR AUC (cut-point of \u22653) for inpatient mortality was 0.80 (95% CI 0.78\u20130.82) and 7-day mortality was 0.82 (95% CI 0.79-0.84).</p> <p>While the derivation and validation cohort populations were relatively similar in terms of the underlying SOAR component variables, approximately 20% of patients in the validation cohort (that had substantially higher rates of hemorrhagic stroke and overall mortality) were excluded due to incomplete data. </p> <p><a href=\"http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/47/1/74.long\" target=\"_blank\">Abdul-Rahim et al</a> derived the mSOAR Score in a retrospective study from 2016 that incorporated baseline NIHSS scores into the SOAR Scores of approximately 1,000 inpatients from two UK-based stroke registries. The study compared both SOAR and mSOAR in their ability to predict mortality within 90 days of admission (rather than during admission). This study also externally validated both the SOAR and mSOAR Scores in an independent 1,000-patient stroke cohort also based in the UK.</p> <p>For SOAR, AUC for mortality \u226490 days in the derivation and validation cohorts was 0.79 (95% CI 0.75-0.84) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.77-0.85), respectively. For mSOAR, AUC in the same cohorts were 0.83 (95%CI, 0.79-0.86) and 0.84 (95% CI 0.82-0.88), respectively. The AUCs of SOAR and mSOAR in derivation cohorts were statistically significantly different (p &lt;0.0001), suggesting that the addition of the NIHSS score significantly improved the predictive accuracy of the original SOAR. While quite similar to the original SOAR derivation cohort, both mSOAR derivation and validation cohorts were more functional at baseline (mRS 0-1 84.8% vs 69%), and the comparative stroke severity of the cohort from <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23834262\" target=\"_blank\">Myint et al</a> was unknown.</p>", "references_list": {"Original/Primary Reference": [{"href": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23834262 ", "text": "Myint PK, Clark AB, Kwok CS, et al.
