It was then validated using data from &nbsp;a second cohort in the smaller MIST2 study. This important RCT determined that combination tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and deoxyribonuclease (DNase) was the most effective treatment for those with pleural infection requiring tube drainage. Applying the score to the MIST2 group showed a similar separation in 3-month survival between the low, moderate and high-risk groups of patients enrolled into the study. </p> <p>A potential criticism of this approach is that enrollment criteria for RCTs are often not representative of the general population, and so a score derived from such studies would be limited in its use. The authors found no clear signal predicting the need for surgery at three months.</p> <p>Subsequently, the RAPID Score was retrospectively assessed in a \u201creal-world\u201d population by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26193196\" target=\"_blank\">White et al (2015)</a>. Their data once again demonstrated clear delineation between the three outcome groups, lending further weight to the validity of the RAPID Score. However, their population only included patients with culture-positive disease. Only 32% of patients in the MIST2 cohort were culture positive, the rest being diagnosed by alternative means. It is possible that patients with culture-positive fluid fare worse than those without, which would affect the results of this study. In addition, 25% of patients had missing data.</p> <p>The PILOT study (ISRCTN50236700) was designed specifically to prospectively assess the RAPID Score.
