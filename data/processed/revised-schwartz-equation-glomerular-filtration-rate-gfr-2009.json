Was there a particular clinical experience or patient encounter that inspired you to create this tool for clinicians?</strong></p>\n<p>Estimating GFR takes much less time, and measurement of GFR is very laborious. We used to calculate all the GFRs as fellows at Albert Einstein in the Bronx, New York. We hypothesized that serum creatinine by itself might not be a great marker because growth occurs in children, and with growth is the accretion of muscle mass, which raises serum creatinine. Thus, we tested formulas with a body habitus component as well as serum <g class=\"gr_ gr_46 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"46\" data-gr-id=\"46\">creatinine,</g> and found that height divided by serum creatinine (Ht/<g class=\"gr_ gr_40 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"40\" data-gr-id=\"40\">Scr</g>) worked the best.</p>\n<p><strong>What pearls, pitfalls and/or tips do you have for users of the Schwartz Equation for GFR?

Are there any adjustments or updates you would make to the score based on new data or practice changes?</strong></p>\n<p>The updated eGFR from 2009 works well, especially with enzymatic serum creatinine. One has to average this with the CKD-EPI eGFR for adolescents and young adults between 18 and 26.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you use the Schwartz Equation for GFR in your own clinical practice? Can you give an example of a scenario in which you use it?</strong></p>\n<p>I use this regularly to stage my patients. If I&nbsp;am unclear as to whether or not this estimate makes sense, I send out a cystatin C. GFR can be estimated by 70.69 x CysC<sup>-0.931</sup>. If the two univariate estimates agree within 10%, then that is the eGFR. If there is disagreement, try to see which estimate is likely off. If this is not obvious, you may have to measure GFR in such a patient.</p>\n<p><strong>Any other research in the pipeline that you&rsquo;re particularly excited about?</strong></p>\n<p>The Chronic Kidney Disease in Children Study (CKiD) hopes to have a more globally applied eGFR after recruitment of the third cohort.
