A number of online databases were searched for US randomized control trials of liberal fluids vs. goal-directed therapy. 3,861 patients from 23 goal-directed studies and 1,160 from 12 liberal fluid studies were reviewed. Patients in the liberal group of the LVR stratum had a higher risk of pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and a longer hospital stay. Using goal-directed therapy resulted in a lower risk of pneumonia, renal complications, and a shorter length of hospital stay compared to liberal fluid management. Liberal fluid therapy was associated with an increased length of hospital stay, time to first bowel movement, and risk of pneumonia compared to goal-directed therapy (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22253274\" target=\"_blank\">Corcoran 2012</a>).</p> <p><strong>Postop GI dysfunction:</strong></p> <p>Postoperative GI dysfunction is a frequent complication of patients undergoing surgery, postulated to be secondary to splanchnic hypoperfusion.

They evaluated GI complications as major or minor, where major was considered life threatening or required surgical intervention, and minor required only medical therapy. Both major and minor GI complications were reduced using goal directed therapy (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19837807\" target=\"_blank\">Giglio 2009</a>).</p> <p><strong>Clinician judgment vs. Doppler evaluation of fluid status:</strong></p> <p>108 patients undergoing elective colorectal resection were studied in a double blind, prospective randomized control trial in which an esophageal Doppler probe was placed intraoperatively. In one group, patients received perioperative fluid at the anesthesiologist\u2019s discretion, whereas in the other group, patients received fluid boluses per Doppler evaluation. Aortic flow time, stroke volume cardiac output, and cardiac index were all higher in the intervention group; additional improved outcomes included decreased postoperative hospital stay, fewer postoperative complications, and ability to tolerate PO intake earlier (<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bjs.5454/full\" target=\"_blank\">Noblett 2006</a>).  </p> <p><strong>Liberal vs. restrictive strategy:</strong></p> <p>In this study, two different intraoperative fluid regimens were utilized and postoperative outcomes evaluated in 152 patients with ASA physical status of I-III and undergoing elective intra-abdominal surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups and given either liberal or restrictive fluid volumes. Results included lower complication rate, earlier BM, and shorter hospital stays in the restrictive group as compared to the liberal group. They also found that postoperative days 1 to 3, the restrictive fluid group had significantly higher hematocrit and albumin concentrations (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15983453\" target=\"_blank\">Nisanevich 2005</a>).</p> <p><strong>0.9% saline vs. Plasma-Lyte:</strong></p> <p>In this study by Shaw et al, researchers looked at the morbidity and mortality effects of using 0.9% saline as compared to Plasma-Lyte, a balanced fluid solution. The hypothesis came as the result of the potential for high volumes of 0.9% saline to cause hyperchloremic acidosis. Looking at the Premier Perspective Comparative Database, 30,000+ patients who underwent major open abdominal surgery with 0.9% saline and 926 patients with balanced crystalloid solution were evaluated. They looked primarily at major morbidity and secondarily at acidosis-related complications. The researchers found that there was a 2% higher chance of mortality in the saline group, and using a match study, found that there was a 10% increase in chance of complications such as renal failure requiring dialysis, need for transfusions, electrolyte disturbances and infections in the saline group compared to the balanced fluid group (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22470070\" target=\"_blank\">Shaw 2012</a>).</p>", "references_list": {"Original/Primary Reference": [{"href": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22253274  ", "text": "Corcoran T, Rhodes JE, Clarke S, Myles PS, Ho KM.
