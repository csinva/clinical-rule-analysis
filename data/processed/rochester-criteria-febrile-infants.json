Was there a particular clinical experience or patient encounter that inspired you to create this tool for clinicians?</strong></p> <p>Prior to the development of the Rochester Criteria, the consensus was that there was no way to predict which child under 3 months of age will have serious bacterial infection (SBI). Too many children that obviously did not have much risk to have SBI were hospitalized, submitted to sepsis workup, and treated with antibiotics for 2-3 days at least. My thought was that instead of looking for who has SBI, we needed to look at those who are very likely NOT to have SBI.</p> <p>I have used my clinical experience from my residency in Israel to set a list of criteria that would suggest no SBI and tested them first in Rochester (during my fellowship) and then submitted them for validation later in Israel. These criteria were proved to be able to rule out more than 2/3 of the \"suspected\" children under 3 months of age, and thus only ~1/3 needed to be subjected to sepsis workup.</p> <p><strong>What pearls, pitfalls and/or tips do you have for users of the Rochester Criteria? Do you know of cases when it has been applied, interpreted, or used inappropriately?</strong></p> <ol> <li>Remember that part of these criteria is the absence of previous history that suggests SBI (previously healthy!).</li> <li>Remember that any real sick looking baby (i.e., toxic) should be treated anyhow.</li> <li>Remember that very low risk is still not 100% proof! The group of neonates under 2-3 weeks was the minority in these studies, so be even more careful with this group before you decide they are low risk.</li> <li>Remember to follow all those who are not treated very carefully!</li> </ol> <p><strong>What recommendations do you have for doctors once they have applied the Rochester Criteria?

Can you give an example of a scenario in which you use it?</strong></p> <p>In our pediatric emergency room at the Soroka University Medical Center in Beer-Sheva, Israel, the Rochester criteria are the gold standard guidelines for suspected sepsis or febrile children &lt;2-3 months.
