The presence of an anti-D leads to a potential risk for HDFN in future pregnancies. Therefore, to prevent HDFN and the formation of an anti-D in the mother, RhIG is given to the mother at 28 weeks and after birth. The amount of RhIG given to the mother after birth is dependent on the amount of fetal-maternal hemorrhage. This formula calculates the amount of fetal-maternal hemorrhage as well as the number of RhIG vials be given to the mother.</p>"}, "next_steps": {"advice_en": "<p>RhIG&nbsp;should be&nbsp;given to the mother at 28 weeks and after birth.</p>", "management_en": "", "critical_actions_en": ""}, "about": {"formula_en": "<p>Number of RhIG vials = fetal cells/total cells counted &times; maternal blood volume, mL / 30 mL</p>\n<p>Then, round&nbsp;to the nearest&nbsp;whole number and add 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flow cytometry of fetal cells in maternal blood stream = 1.7%</li>\n<li>Total maternal blood volume =&nbsp;3,700 mL</li>\n<li>Volume of fetal blood in maternal blood stream =&nbsp;3,700 x 0.017 = 62.9 mL</li>\n<li>Number of RhIG vials = 62.9 / 30 = 2.1 vials --&gt; round down to 2 and add 1</li>\n<li>RhIG vials to administer = 3 vials</li>\n</ul>", "more_info_en": "", "evidence_based_medicine_en": "", "references_list": {"Original/Primary Reference": [{"text": "Kennedy, M, Delaney M, Scrape S.
