It used a double-blind randomized design to compare opioid withdrawal symptoms for intramuscularly administered placebo vs. naloxone to 46 opioid-dependent participants. COWS and CINA scores during the naloxone challenge session were well correlated with Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.85 (p&lt;0.001) while placebo was not associated with any significant elevation in either score. Additional evidence of concurrent validity was provided by comparing COWS with the self-reporting visual analog scale (VAS); COWS scores correlated well with peak VAS scores of bad drug effect (r=0.57, p&lt;0.001) and feeling sick (r=0.57, p&lt;0.001).
