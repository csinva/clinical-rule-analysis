Righini", "qa_en": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why did you develop the Age-Adjusted D-dimer? Was there a particular clinical experience or patient encounter that inspired you to create this tool for clinicians?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">D-dimer measurement is a very important step in VTE diagnosis, as it allows clinicians to rule out the disease in around 30% of outpatients with suspected DVT or PE. However, the test is less useful in elderly patients (as D-dimer tests at a cutoff of 500 ng/mL are rarely truly negative). Therefore, we tried increasing the cutoff in elderly patients. Our retrospective validation suggested that an &ldquo;age per 10&rdquo; cutoff in patients above 50 years would be safe, and we conducted a prospective validation study, which confirmed this.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What pearls, pitfalls and/or tips do you have for users of the Age-Adjusted D-dimer? Do you know of cases when it has been applied, interpreted, or used inappropriately?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some important points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As with all D-dimer tests, they should be used after an assessment of clinical probability.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mainly, ELISA and immunoturbidimetric tests have been used. But this represents the vast majority of tests used.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Limited data exist on D-dimers with cutoffs set at 250 ng/mL. Retrospective studies suggest that in this case, the age-adjusted cutoff is &ldquo;age per 5&rdquo;, meaning that you can rule out PE in a patient of 60 years if the result of the test is less than 300 ng/mL.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Are there any adjustments or updates you would make to the score based on new data or practice changes?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">No. We have robust prospective validation and retrospective validation in more than 50,000 patients from everywhere in the world.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How do you use the Age-Adjusted D-dimer in your own clinical practice? Can you give an example of a scenario in which you use it?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We use it in every clinical practice for outpatients with suspected PE.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Any other research in the pipeline that you&rsquo;re particularly excited about?</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-d0c20d7e-7fff-e720-2508-e9a592a75741\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The prospective validation for the cutoff in patients with suspected DVT is running, which should allow in the future a one-size-fits-all cutoff for suspected PE and/or suspected DVT.</p>", "approved": false, "creator_info": {"about_en": "Marc P.
