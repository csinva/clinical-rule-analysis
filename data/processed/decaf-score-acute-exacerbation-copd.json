Was there a particular clinical experience or patient encounter that inspired you to create this tool for clinicians?</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exacerbations of COPD (ECOPD) disrupt patients' lives, are a very common reason for hospital admission and have a significant in-hospital mortality rate. Clinicians' estimates of prognosis in patients hospitalized with ECOPD are frequently inaccurate. We developed the DECAF score because a simple, reliable, accurate prediction tool could potentially improve patient care, by identifying patients suitable for hospital discharge or for more intensive therapy / monitoring.</p> <p><strong>What pearls, pitfalls and/or tips do you have for users of the DECAF Score? Do you know of cases when it has been applied, interpreted, or used inappropriately?</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DECAF is simple to calculate and apply at the bedside. It requires an assessment of the patient&rsquo;s usual level of breathlessness and function: the eMRCD score. Errors can be made by misclassification of the eMRCD. eMRCD records an individual's level of breathlessness when they are stable; i.e., \"on a good day, during the preceding 3 months.\" </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In summary, eMRCD 5a is defined by an individual who is \"Too breathless to leave their house unassisted but independent in washing and/or dressing\"; eMRCD 5b indicates a patient who is \"Too breathless to leave the house unassisted and requires help with washing and dressing.\" Simple walking aids do not constitute assistance but wheelchairs and mobility scooters do.</p> <p><strong>How do you use the DECAF Score in your own clinical practice? </strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To identify low risk patients (DECAF 0-1) who are suitable for hospital at home or early supported discharge. We have performed an RCT of <a href=\"http://www.hospitalathome.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hospital at Home</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> versus usual care, with patient selection by DECAF Score.
