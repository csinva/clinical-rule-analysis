It was first published as a manual in 1989, and most recently updated in 2001. The AUDIT-C was developed in 1998 due to the recognition that the 10-question length of the AUDIT made it unlikely that primary providers would incorporate it into routine patient interviews or general health history questionnaires. In studying a VA primary care setting, they found that although the full AUDIT performed better than AUDIT-C for detecting active alcohol abuse or dependence (0.811 vs 0.786;P<.001), the 2 questionnaires performed similarly for detecting heavy drinking and/or active abuse or dependence (0.880 vs 0.881).

The results indicated that AUDIT-C was an effective screening test for alcohol misuse in this primary care sample, with optimal screening thresholds for alcohol misuse among men (\u22654) and women (\u22653).</p> <p><strong>Validation article</strong> (<a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2517893/' target='_blank'>Frank 2008</a>)</a>:</p> <p>The first validation article utilized primarily a CaucasianWhite population. This article evaluated the validity of the AUDIT-C among primary care patients from an expanded group of racial subgroups including CaucasiansWhites, African Americans, and Hispanics. Areas under the receiver operating curve (AuROCs) evaluated overall AUDIT-C performance in the 3 racial/ethnic groups compared to diagnostic interviews for alcohol misuse. The overall performance of the AUDIT-C was excellent in all 3 racial/ethnic groups as reflected by high AuROCs.</p>", "references_list": {"Original/Primary Reference": [{"href": "https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/67205/WHO_MSD_MSB_01.6a.pdf;jsessionid=1FAFA3CC325018FC69178F3AF9944665?sequence=1", "text": "Babor TF, Higgins-Biddle JC, Saunders JB and Monteiro M.
