Laboratories typically only measure the bound portion of phenytoin. Many equations to predict unbound phenytoin concentrations have been developed. The Winter-Tozer formula (also known as Sheiner-Tozer) is one of the most widely used equations (Sheiner 1978). However, this equation was derived by using pharmacokinetics from subjects who were otherwise healthy (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/599408\" target=\"_blank\">Martin 1977</a>). Subsequent research has shown it to be less accurate in critically ill patients with renal failure or low albumin.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The original formulas used an albumin binding coefficient (see below) of 0.2, and 0.1 for patients with renal failure (Winter 2006). These equations assumed a normal serum albumin and an unbound drug portion of 10%. However, these coefficients have been found to be inaccurate, especially when serum albumin levels are low (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730613/\" target=\"_blank\">Hong 2009</a>), or when renal function is poor (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6538287\" target=\"_blank\">Liponi 1984</a>).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Different coefficients have shown better correlations with free phenytoin levels, ranging from 0.25 in the elderly and in head trauma (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9066931\" target=\"_blank\">Anderson 1997</a>) to 0.29 in neurointensive care patients (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23606554\" target=\"_blank\">Kane 2013</a>). Another study comprised of general medicine, neurology, and intensive care patients showed a coefficient of 0.275 to be most predictive (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27621486\" target=\"_blank\">Cheng 2016</a>). For this calculator, a coefficient of 0.275 was used for non-renal failure, which was felt to represent a compromise between the trauma and ICU studies, and had been derived from the most diverse patient sample.</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-886f76f4-7fff-90c1-e658-e1c96d6ace61\">Less is known about phenytoin in renal failure, but at least one smaller study supports a coefficient of 0.2 in these patients (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28470115\" target=\"_blank\">Soriano 2017</a>). However, it should be noted that none of these equations has been validated by a prospective trial, and whenever possible, free phenytoin levels should be used to guide therapy.</span></p>", "references_list": {"Original/Primary Reference": [{"href": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/599408", "text": "Martin E, Tozer TN, Sheiner LB, Riegelman S.
