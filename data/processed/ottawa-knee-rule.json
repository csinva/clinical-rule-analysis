Study enrolled 1,054 subjects, of whom 68 had fractures, 66 of them deemed to be clinically significant (not simple avulsion fragment &lt; 5 mm in breadth without associated complete tendon or ligament disruption). Using recursive-partitioning techniques, authors derived the five variables of their decision rule. If applied to the study population, their decision rule had sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 54% for identifying fractures and would lead to a 28% relative reduction in x-ray utilization.</li>\n<li>Stiell et al then prospectively validated their decision rule in the same patient population. They performed telephone follow-up 14 days after the ED visit to determine the possibility of a missed fracture. Sensitivity of the decision rule was again 100%, identifying 63 clinically important fractures out of 1096 patients. Specificity was similar to the derivation study, at 49%, and they also found a 28% relative reduction in x-ray utilization.</li>\n<li>Stiell et al prospectively implemented the decision rule in different teaching and community emergency departments. They found a relative reduction in x-ray usage of 26.4% while maintaining a sensitivity of 100% for detecting 58 knee fractures out of 3907 patients and a specificity of 48%. Moreover, there was a significant reduction in time to discharge and total medical charges in those patients who did not get an x-ray.</li>\n<li>The Ottawa Knee Rules have also been prospectively validated in populations outside of Canada. Two studies, one done in Spain and another in the United States, found that the Ottawa Knee Rules had a sensitivity of 100% and 98%, specificity of 52% and 19%, and a reduction in x-ray usage by 49% and 17%.</li>\n<li>These rules were applied to children aged 2 to 16 years of age in a prospective, multicenter validation study in 2003. That study found the decision rule to be 100% sensitive in finding 70 fractures out of 750 children, with a specificity of 42.8% and a potential reduction in x-ray usage by 31.2%.</li>\n<li>The Ottawa Knee Rules have also been compared to the Pittsburgh decision rules, another well-validated clinical decision rule. A cross-sectional comparison of the two rules showed that both had sensitivities of 86% though the Pittsburgh decision rule was significantly more specific. However, this study only included patients aged 18-79 and excluded pediatric patients.</li>\n</ul>", "references_list": {"Validation": [{"text": "Stiell IG, et al.
