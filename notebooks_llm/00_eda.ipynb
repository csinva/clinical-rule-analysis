Professor Williams argues that \\nHodgson  et al have misapplied the NEWS2 SpO 2  scale ( SpO 2 \\nscale 2 ) to all patients with AECOPD, 2 rather than employing \\nit only in those with conﬁrmed hypercapnic respiratory failure \\n(HCRF) as recommended. 3 Williams suggests Hodgson's study \\nhighlights the need for ‘further education’ to avoid improper \\nuse of NEWS2 in patients without HCRF, implying that if training \\nis not undertaken NEWS2 will create a risk for such patients. \\nThis risk might be worthwhile if NEWS2 performed better than \\nNEWS in patients with HCRF. However, in another study of \\nNEWS2, 4 we evaluated  SpO 2 scale 2 in patients with/without \\nHCRF. We observed reduced sensitivity for in-hospital mortality \\ncompared to NEWS for patients in two groups – those with \\nconﬁrmed HCRF and those at risk of HCRF (eg patients with \\nchronic lung disease). Importantly, if used in error in patients \\nnot at risk of HCRF, NEWS2 generally reduces discrimination \\ncompared to NEWS. \\n We agree with Hodgson  et al that  SpO 2 scale 2 might be \\napplied in error to other patient groups (eg those admitted \\nwith AECOPD, but without HCRF) when NEWS2 is implemented \\nacross hospitals and ambulance trusts. While the NEWS2 \\nrecommendations 3 are clear that HCRF should ﬁrst be \\nconﬁrmed before using  SpO 2 scale 2 , the British Thoracic Society \\nrecommendations state that\\n For most patients with known COPD or other known risk factors \\nfor hypercapnic respiratory failure … a target saturation range \\nof 88–92% is suggested pending the availability of blood gas \\nresults … 5 \\n This presents a dilemma, especially for ambulance staff, \\nregarding whether to initially titrate oxygen therapy to maintain \\nsaturations of 88–92% for all patients  at risk of HCRF, or to wait \\nuntil HCRF is conﬁrmed. \\n As Hodgson  et al  suggest, this conﬂict could be addressed by \\nfurther exploration of the relationship between oxygen therapy, \\noxygen saturations and the risk of adverse outcomes.

Although clinical diagnosis is recommended, scrotal ultrasound is frequently ordered, delaying treatment. We created a scoring system\\nto diagnose testicular torsion, decreasing the indication for ultrasound.\\nMaterials and Methods.dWe prospectively evaluated 338 patients with\\nacute scrotum, of whom 51 had testicular torsion. Physical examination\\nwas performed by a urologist, and all patients underwent scrotal ultrasound. Univariate analysis and logistic regression were performed, and a\\nscoring system for risk stratiﬁcation of torsion was created. Retrospective\\nvalidation was performed with 2 independent data sets.\\nResults.dThe scoring system consisted of testicular swelling (2 points),\\nhard testicle (2), absent cremasteric reﬂex (1), nausea/vomiting (1) and\\nhigh riding testis (1). Cutoffs for low and high risk were 2 and 5 points,\\nrespectively. Ultrasound would be indicated only for the intermediate\\nrisk group. In the prospective data set 69% of patients had low, 19% intermediate and 11.5% high risk. Negative and positive predictive values were\\n100% for cutoffs of 2 and 5, respectively (speciﬁcity 81%, sensitivity\\n76%). Retrospective validation in 1 data set showed 66% of patients at\\nlow, 16% intermediate and 17% high risk. Negative and positive predictive values for cutoffs of 2 and 5 were 100% (speciﬁcity 97%, sensitivity\\n54%). The second retrospective data set included only torsion cases, none\\nof which was misdiagnosed by the scoring system.\\nConclusions.dThis scoring system can potentially diagnose or rule out\\ntesticular torsion in 80% of cases, with high positive and negative predictive\\nvalues for selected cutoffs. Ultrasound orders would be decreased to 20%\\nof acute scrotum cases. Prospective validation of this scoring system is\\nnecessary.\\n:\\nThe TWIST (testicular workup for ischemia and suspected torsion) study\\ndevelops a scoring system to help predict the need for imaging or surgical exploration in boys with testicular pain. Surprisingly, the average duration of symptoms before evaluation at Boston Children’s Hospital was 72 hours. This alone\\nmakes it less likely that the boys were being evaluated for acute testicular torsion.\\nIndeed, two-thirds of the patients were deemed low risk based on the criteria in\\nthe scoring system. The results may differ if a subset of patients presenting\\nacutely was evaluated.\\nI ﬁnd that the real issue is that primary care and emergency room (ER) physicians have different physical examination skills and a different threshold for\\nordering tests and consulting urologists. From my standpoint, this scoring\\nsystem would be more useful if it was created and validated in a primary or ER\\nsetting. This would further decrease the overutilization of scrotal imaging in\\n6 / Urology\\n\n",

BRADSHAW\\nBristol Royal Infirmary and Frenchay Hospital, Bristol\\nTHE management of Crohn’s disease is difficult because of\\nthe relapsing nature of the condition, its protean manifestations, and the relative ineffectiveness of drugs other than\\ncorticosteroids. A numerical index of degree of illness\\n(\"activity\") of Crohn’s disease has been found by various\\nworkers to be very helpful in the management of patients, both\\nas a measure of the response to individual treatments and to\\nassess long-term progress. It has proved particularly useful in\\ncollaborative multicentre studies. The index developed by the\\nNational Cooperative Crohn’s Disease- Study Group in the\\nU.S.A.’ is calculated from eight mainly clinical variables;\\nand although it seems to give the information required it is\\ncumbersome in practice.2 A diary card has to be completed by\\nthe patient for one week before assessment of the index, and\\nvarious weighting factors have to be calculated later. We have\\ndesigned a simple index of Crohn’s-disease activity and have\\ncompared it, in a prospective study of 112 consecutive patients,\\nwith the more complex index devised by the National Cooperative Crohn’s Disease Study Group.’\\nMETHOD\\nThe simple index is based on only five items:\\nA. General wellbeing (0=very well, l=slightly below par,\\n2=poor, 3=very poor, 4=terrible).\\nB. Abdominal \\npain \\n(0=none, \\n1=mild, \\n2=moderate,\\n3=severe).\\nC. Number of liquid stools per day.\\nD. Abdominal mass (0=none, l=dubious, 2=definite,\\n3=definite and tender).\\nE. Complications: arthralgia, uveitis, erythema nodosum,\\naphthous ulcers, pyoderma gangrenosum, anal fissure,\\nnew fistula, abscess (score 1 per item).\\n4!in .&mdash;&mdash;.&mdash;&mdash;,&mdash;&mdash;,&mdash;&mdash;.&mdash;&mdash;.&mdash;&mdash;.&mdash;&mdash;.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,&mdash;&mdash;.&mdash;&mdash;.&mdash;&mdash;,&mdash; < \\n&mdash;.&mdash;&mdash;.&mdash;&mdash;.\\n’SimpLe’index\\nComparison between \"simple\" and \"complex\" indices of\\nCrohn’s-disease activity in 112 patients.\\nSince a visit to the outpatient clinic might cause some variation in items A, B, and C, patients are asked to score these\\nitems for the previous day.\\nAs part of a prospective study of Crohn’s disease, 112\\nconsecutive patients attending a gastroenterology clinic were\\nassessed with the index described by the National Cooperative\\nCrohn’s Disease Study Group and immediately afterwards\\nwith the simple index described here.\\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\\nThe correlation between this simple index and the more\\ncomplex one is shown in the figure. Essentially the same information appears to be given by both methods, and with the\\nsimple index a very adequate numerical measurement of\\nseverity based on clinical criteria can be obtained easily and\\nquickly at a single outpatient visit. There seems to be no need\\nto average symptoms out over a period of seven days or to use\\nweighting factors. No clinical index can be entirely objective,\\nbut this new index provides a simple and practical measure of\\nclinical activity of Crohn’s disease which should be reproducible in different centres. The estimation does not have to\\nbe planned in advance, so can be used with newly diagnosed\\npatients or those with unexpected relapse. It is also independent\\nof (but complementary to) laboratory criteria of inflammatory\\nactivity, such as measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation\\nrate, plasma viscosity, or C-reactive protein.\\nREFERENCES\\n1.

This is success by any yardstick, yet, surprisingly, there has been only one previous textbook on this\\nimportant subject, the Pregnant Diabetic and Her Newborn.\\nby the late Dr Jorgen Pedersen. This present volume lacks the\\npersonal quality of Pedersen’s book, but it is a most useful\\ncompendium for the specialist. The editors, an obstetrician and\\na paediatrician, have produced a comprehensive and on the\\nwhole readable account, made up of nineteen contributions\\nEven those who disagree with some parts will find the very full\\nlist of references at the end of each chapter useful. The book\\nis divided logically into three sections covering metabolic and\\nclinical considerations for the mother, the effects of maternal\\ndiabetes on the placenta and fetus, and the biochemical, physiological, and pathological implications for the neonate. The\\n\"pure scientific\" chapters on the physiology of normal and dl.1betic pregnancy, the structure and function of the placenta.\\nand the physiological and biochemical abnormalities in the !r.fant are excellent.

A bottle of propranolol was found in the patient's room on the fourth day of\\nhospitalization. The serum level of propranolol was found to\\nbe 321 ng/ml (Bioscience Laboratories). The patient was\\nseen in consultation by a psychiatrist, who recommended\\ntelling the patient of the elevated concentrations of propranolol in her blood. She continued to deny abuse of the agent\\nand left the hospital against medical advice. She stood to gain\\nconsiderable financial benefit if a diagnosis of organic \"heart\\ndisease were established.\\nDISCUSSION\\nSurreptitious drug abuse producing syndromes mimicking\\ndiseases is a well-known phenomenon. Commonly reported\\nagents include insulins and diuretic drugs.• To our knowledge, this represents the first report of abuse of propranolol to\\ncause bradycardia and hypotension. Patients who surreptitiously ingest drugs are frequently, like our patient, in medically related fields.5 No definite patterns of age or sex are\\napparent, although many patients have been in their third to\\nfifth decades of life. No single psychiatric disorder appears to\\napply to most reported cases. In conclusion, unsuspected\\nusage of propranolol should be considered in the diagnosis of\\nunexplained syncope, bradycardia, and hypotension.\\nGwynne K. Neufeld, M.D., andScott P.

It is good to see that someone believes in the correct\\n\"alveolar air equation:' An arithmetically easier equation is\\nwelcome. I hope that it will stimulate workers to analyze\\nexpired air for oxygen, as well as carbon dioxide, with their\\nelectrodes.\\nI offer a diHerent derivation in the hope that it will explain\\nthe final equation a little better and emphasize the validity of\\nRaymond's presentation. Since expired gas is made up of\\nalveolar gas and dead-space gas, the \"mixing equation\" can\\nbe used with electrode values for expired gas partial pres748\\nCOMMUNICATIONS TO THE EDITOR\\nsures as follows (all conditions are body temperature and\\npressure, saturated) :\\nwhere VA is alveolar ventilation, VD is dead-space ventilation,\\nVE is total (ie, expired) ventilation, PAO2 is the partial\\npressure of oxygen in alveolar gas, PI02 is the partial\\npressure of oxygen in the inspired gas, .and PE02 is the\\npartial pressure of oxygen in the expired gas.\\nThe assumption originally made by Lilienthal and Riley2\\nthat the partial pressure of Carbon dioxide in alveolar gas\\n(PAC02) equals the tension of carbon dioxide in arterial\\nblood (PaC02) can be used when there is little shunt. Bohr's\\nequation then can be modified, assuming the inspired gas is\\nfree of carbon dioxide, as follows:\\nwhere VD equals dead-space volume, VT equals tidal volume,\\nand PEC02 equals the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in\\nthe expired gas. Remembering that\\nand\\nsubstitution then provides the following equation:\\nPA02 (VE VE X VD/VT) + (PI02 X \\FE X VD/VT) =\\nPE02 X VE\\nRearranging and factoring, this becomes\\nVE(PEO., - PIO? X VD/VT\\nPA02 =---------VE(I- VD/VT)\\nCancelling gives the following equation:\\nPE0 2 PI02 X VD/VT\\nPA02 c= -------1- VD/VT\\nwhich is what Raymond- presented. It .allows calculation of\\nPA02, regardless of the state of the patient and regardless of\\nthe oxygen concentration of the inspired gas, as long as the\\nexpired air is collected while the arterial sample is taken and\\nis analyzed for oxygen pressure, as well as carbon dioxide\\npressure. Of course, it is a good idea to run a sample of\\ninspired gas through the electrodes, too.\\nH.

All rights reserved.\\nORIGINAL RESEARCH \\nClinical Medicine 2017 Vol 17, No 6: 260–8\\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR \\nClinical Medicine 2019 Vol 19, No 3: 260–3\\n The National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2)  \\n Editor – Hodgson  et al 1 demonstrate that the recent modiﬁcation \\nof the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) – NEWS2 – prove \\nless sensitive than NEWS in identifying in-hospital death \\nfor patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive \\npulmonary disease (AECOPD). Professor Williams argues that \\nHodgson  et al have misapplied the NEWS2 SpO 2  scale ( SpO 2 \\nscale 2 ) to all patients with AECOPD, 2 rather than employing \\nit only in those with conﬁrmed hypercapnic respiratory failure \\n(HCRF) as recommended. 3 Williams suggests Hodgson's study \\nhighlights the need for ‘further education’ to avoid improper \\nuse of NEWS2 in patients without HCRF, implying that if training \\nis not undertaken NEWS2 will create a risk for such patients. \\nThis risk might be worthwhile if NEWS2 performed better than \\nNEWS in patients with HCRF. However, in another study of \\nNEWS2, 4 we evaluated  SpO 2 scale 2 in patients with/without \\nHCRF. We observed reduced sensitivity for in-hospital mortality \\ncompared to NEWS for patients in two groups – those with \\nconﬁrmed HCRF and those at risk of HCRF (eg patients with \\nchronic lung disease). Importantly, if used in error in patients \\nnot at risk of HCRF, NEWS2 generally reduces discrimination \\ncompared to NEWS. \\n We agree with Hodgson  et al that  SpO 2 scale 2 might be \\napplied in error to other patient groups (eg those admitted \\nwith AECOPD, but without HCRF) when NEWS2 is implemented \\nacross hospitals and ambulance trusts. While the NEWS2 \\nrecommendations 3 are clear that HCRF should ﬁrst be \\nconﬁrmed before using  SpO 2 scale 2 , the British Thoracic Society \\nrecommendations state that\\n For most patients with known COPD or other known risk factors \\nfor hypercapnic respiratory failure … a target saturation range \\nof 88–92% is suggested pending the availability of blood gas \\nresults … 5 \\n This presents a dilemma, especially for ambulance staff, \\nregarding whether to initially titrate oxygen therapy to maintain \\nsaturations of 88–92% for all patients  at risk of HCRF, or to wait \\nuntil HCRF is conﬁrmed. \\n As Hodgson  et al  suggest, this conﬂict could be addressed by \\nfurther exploration of the relationship between oxygen therapy, \\noxygen saturations and the risk of adverse outcomes. Currently, \\nthe only studies comparing the performance of NEWS2 and \\nNEWS 1,4 suggest that the added complexity of NEWS2 is unlikely \\nto be offset by signiﬁcant beneﬁt to patients and might lead to \\nharm. As NEWS2 is now mandated by NHS England, 6 prospective \\nevaluation of its application in the ‘real world’ must be urgently \\nand carefully conducted. ■ \\n Letters to the editor \\n References \\n 1  Hodgson  LE ,  Congleton  J ,  Venn  R ,  Forni  LG ,  Roderick  PJ .
